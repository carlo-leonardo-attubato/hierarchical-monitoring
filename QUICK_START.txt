Hi! Please run the toy experiment to validate our hierarchical monitoring approach:

python toy_experiment.py

This compares:
1. Our hierarchical training (end-to-end with soft gates)
2. Baseline probe (trained standalone) + hierarchical deployment

Expected: Hierarchical training shows better recall at same budget.

See CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md for full context. The experiment should take ~2 minutes and output results + plots.

Key question: Does hierarchical training beat baseline approach for recall on harmful outputs?
